  The Slim Scanner allows you to better assess your container security every time you build a new container.
  It provides a Container Profile ("X-Ray") and aggregated Vulnerability Report for a given container build using the Slim Developer Platform.
  The generated reports will be uploaded to CircleCI's Artifacts tab as JSON documents.
