  This orb can be used to generate a Container Profile ("X-Ray") report for a given container build using the Slim Developer Platform. The generated report will be uploaded to CircleCI's Artifacts tab as a JSON document, and the container image will also be added to the user's "Favorites" collection in the Slim portal for easy access in the future.
# Provide a use-case based example for using this orb.
# Everything in the `usage` section will be displayed in the orb registry.
# Comments are not retained.
